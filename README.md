# LichessKeyboard

## Briefly about project

This project is essentially a reincarnation of the old project of the same name, blocked by Lichess. This program will allow you to use the keyboard to control chess pieces, thereby equalizing the chances in a quick game for both sides.

##How can I help?

This project is still far from the level of its predecessor, but it will develop and hopefully be able to reach its level.

To speed up the development of the project and the identification of bugs, please send bugs that you encounter here or in private messages on lichess.
